            <p>I was born in Grants Pass, Oregon on April 5th of 1969, the son of Gene  and Glenda Flickinger.  I have two siblings, whose names are Robert and Kelly (Robert has since passed away).  I currently live in Chandler Arizona.  I have been living in Arizona for over 15 years, and I've come to love it here.</p>
            <p>My hobbies include playing computer games, practicing marksmanship with handguns, rifles and bows.  I also like to hike and go camping when I can.  Since my career is almost aways been connected to Information Technology in one form or another, I have extensive experience in the field.</p>
